# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a customer will **churn (leave)** or **stay** based on historical data.  
This project helps businesses improve customer retention by identifying potential churners early.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection** — Load and inspect the dataset  
2. **Data Cleaning** — Handle missing values and categorical encoding  
3. **EDA** — Visualize churn distribution and correlations  
4. **Model Training** — Train and compare ML models  
5. **Model Evaluation** — Analyze confusion matrix and ROC curve  
6. **Prediction** — Predict churn for new customer data
